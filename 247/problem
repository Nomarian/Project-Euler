Problem 247

29 May 2009


Consider the region constrained by 1 ≤ x and 0 ≤ y ≤ ^1/[x].

Let S[1] be the largest square that can fit under the curve.
Let S[2] be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on.
Let the index of S[n] be the pair (left, below) indicating the number of
squares to the left of S[n] and the number of squares below S[n].

[p_247_hype]

The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number.
S[2] has one square to its left and none below, so the index of S[2] is (1,0).
It can be seen that the index of S[32] is (1,1) as is the index of S[50].
50 is the largest n for which the index of S[n] is (1,1).

What is the largest n for which the index of S[n] is (3,3)?
