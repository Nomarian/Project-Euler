Problem 155

19 May 2007


An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units,
which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or
other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.

Using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make
circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up
to n=3 capacitors of 60 ●F each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total
capacitance values:

[p_155_capacitors1]

If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can
obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure
described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ...

Find D(18).

Reminder : When connecting capacitors C[1], C[2] etc in parallel, the total
capacitance is C[T] = C[1] + C[2] +...,
whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by:
[p_155_capsform]
