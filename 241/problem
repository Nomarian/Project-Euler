Problem 241

18 April 2009


For a positive integer n, let σ(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g. σ
(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.

A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with σ(n) = 2n.

                                                                       σ(n)
Let us define the perfection quotient of a positive integer as p(n) =  *    .
                                                                       n

Find the sum of all positive integers n ≤ 10^18 for which p(n) has the form k +
^1⁄[2], where k is an integer.
