Problem 363

18 December 2011

A cubic Be'zier curve is defined by four points: P[0], P[1], P[2] and P[3].

The curve is constructed as follows:
On the segments P[0]P[1], P[1]P[2] and P[2]P[3] the points Q[0],Q[1] and Q[2]
are drawn such that P[0]Q[0]/P[0]P[1]=P[1]Q[1]/P[1]P[2]=P[2]Q[2]/P[2]P[3]=t (t
in [0,1]).
On the segments Q[0]Q[1] and Q[1]Q[2] the points R[0] and R[1] are drawn such
that Q[0]R[0]/Q[0]Q[1]=Q[1]R[1]/Q[1]Q[2]=t for the same value of t.
On the segment R[0]R[1] the point B is drawn such that R[0]B/R[0]R[1]=t for the
same value of t. The Be'zier curve defined by the points P[0], P[1], P[2], P[3]
is the locus of B as Q[0] takes all possible positions on the segment P[0]P[1].
(Please note that for all points the value of t is the same.)

In the applet to the right you can drag the points P[0], P[1], P[2] and P[3] to
see what the Be'zier curve (green curve) defined by those points looks like.
You can also drag the point Q[0] along the segment P[0]P[1].

From the construction it is clear that the Be'zier curve will be tangent to the
segments P[0]P[1] in P[0] and P[2]P[3] in P[3].




A cubic Be'zier curve with P[0]=(1,0), P[1]=(1,v), P[2]=(v,1) and P[3]=(0,1) is
used to approximate a quarter circle.
The value v>0 is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines OP[0], OP[3]
and the curve is equal to ^π/[4] (the area of the quarter circle).

By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length of the
quarter circle?
That is, if L is the length of the curve, calculate 100*^(L-π/2)/[(π/2)].
Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.
