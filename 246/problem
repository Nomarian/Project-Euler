Problem 246

22 May 2009


A definition for an ellipse is:
Given a circle c with centre M and radius r and a point G such that d(G,M)<r,
the locus of the points that are equidistant from c and G form an ellipse.

The construction of the points of the ellipse is shown below.

[p_246_anim]

Given are the points M(-2000,1500) and G(8000,1500).
Given is also the circle c with centre M and radius 15000.
The locus of the points that are equidistant from G and c form an ellipse e.
From a point P outside e the two tangents t[1] and t[2] to the ellipse are
drawn.
Let the points where t[1] and t[2] touch the ellipse be R and S.

[p_246_elli]

For how many lattice points P is angle RPS greater than 45 degrees?
