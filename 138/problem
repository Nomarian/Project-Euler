Problem 138

20 January 2007


Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and legs, L = 17.

[p_138]

By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the
triangle, h = √(17^2 − 8^2) = 15, which is one less than the base length.

With b = 272 and L = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the base
length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property
that h = b +- 1.

Find ∑ L for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which h = b +- 1 and b
, L are positive integers.
