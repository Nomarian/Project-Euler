Problem 313

05 December 2010


In a sliding game a counter may slide horizontally or vertically into an empty
space. The objective of the game is to move the red counter from the top left
corner of a grid to the bottom right corner; the space always starts in the
bottom right corner. For example, the following sequence of pictures show how
the game can be completed in five moves on a 2 by 2 grid.

                                 [sliding_ga]

Let S(m,n) represent the minimum number of moves to complete the game on an m
by n grid. For example, it can be verified that S(5,4) = 25.

                                 [sliding_ga]

There are exactly 5482 grids for which S(m,n) = p^2, where p < 100 is prime.

How many grids does S(m,n) = p^2, where p < 10^6 is prime?
