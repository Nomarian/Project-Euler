Problem 312

28 November 2010


- A Sierpi≈Ñski graph of order-1 (S[1]) is an equilateral triangle.
- S[n+1] is obtained from S[n] by positioning three copies of S[n] so that
every pair of copies has one common corner.

                                 [p_312_sier]

Let C(n) be the number of cycles that pass exactly once through all the
vertices of S[n].
For example, C(3) = 8 because eight such cycles can be drawn on S[3], as shown
below:

                                 [p_312_sier]

It can also be verified that :
C(1) = C(2) = 1
C(5) = 71328803586048
C(10 000) mod 10^8 = 37652224
C(10 000) mod 13^8 = 617720485

Find C(C(C(10 000))) mod 13^8.
