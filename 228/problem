Problem 228

17 January 2009


Let S[n] be the regular n-sided polygon – or shape – whose vertices v[k] (k =
 1,2,…,n) have coordinates:

       x[k]   =   cos( ^2k-1/[n] x180DEG )
       y[k]   =   sin( ^2k-1/[n] x180DEG )

Each S[n] is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on
the perimeter and in the interior.

The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of adding every
point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed
coordinate-wise: (u, v) + (x, y) = (u+x, v+y).

For example, the sum of S[3] and S[4] is the six-sided shape shown in pink
below:

How many sides does S[1864] + S[1865] + … + S[1909] have?
