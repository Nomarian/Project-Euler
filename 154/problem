Problem 154

12 May 2007


A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each ball
rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.

[p_154_pyramid]

Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each position:

A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres
directly below the current position.

Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum of the
numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there are up to three
numbers above it).

The result is Pascal's pyramid and the numbers at each level n are the
coefficients of the trinomial expansion (x + y + z)^n.

How many coefficients in the expansion of (x + y + z)^200000 are multiples of
10^12?
