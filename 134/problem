Problem 134

15 December 2006


Consider the consecutive primes p[1] = 19 and p[2] = 23. It can be verified
that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by p[1]
whilst also being divisible by p[2].

In fact, with the exception of p[1] = 3 and p[2] = 5, for every pair of
consecutive primes, p[2] > p[1], there exist values of n for which the last
digits are formed by p[1] and n is divisible by p[2]. Let S be the smallest of
these values of n.

Find ∑ S for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ p[1] ≤ 1000000.
