Problem 198

14 June 2008


A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is a
rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s â‰¤ d, so that any rational number p
/q which is closer to x than r/s has q > d.

Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all
denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. 9/40 has the two
best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6. We shall call a
real number x ambiguous, if there is at least one denominator bound for which x
possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily
rational.

How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q, 0 < x < 1/100, are there whose denominator
q does not exceed 10^8?
