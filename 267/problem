Problem 267

04 December 2009


You are given a unique investment opportunity.

Starting with -L-1 of capital, you can choose a fixed proportion, f, of your
capital to bet on a fair coin toss repeatedly for 1000 tosses.

Your return is double your bet for heads and you lose your bet for tails.

For example, if f = 1/4, for the first toss you bet -L-0.25, and if heads comes
up you win -L-0.5 and so then have -L-1.5. You then bet -L-0.375 and if the
second toss is tails, you have -L-1.125.

Choosing f to maximize your chances of having at least -L-1,000,000,000 after
1,000 flips, what is the chance that you become a billionaire?

All computations are assumed to be exact (no rounding), but give your answer
rounded to 12 digits behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.
