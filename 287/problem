Problem 287

10 April 2010


The quadtree encoding allows us to describe a 2^Nx2^N black and white image as
a sequence of bits (0 and 1). Those sequences are to be read from left to right
like this:

  • the first bit deals with the complete 2^Nx2^N region;
  • "0" denotes a split:
    the current 2^nx2^n region is divided into 4 sub-regions of dimension 2^n-1
    x2^n-1,
    the next bits contains the description of the top left, top right, bottom
    left and bottom right sub-regions - in that order;
  • "10" indicates that the current region contains only black pixels;
  • "11" indicates that the current region contains only white pixels.

Consider the following 4x4 image (colored marks denote places where a split can
occur):

                                 [p_287_quad]

This image can be described by several sequences, for example : "00101010100
1011111011010101010", of length 30, or
"0100101111101110", of length 16, which is the minimal sequence for this image.

For a positive integer N, define D[N] as the 2^Nx2^N image with the following
coloring scheme:

  • the pixel with coordinates x = 0, y = 0 corresponds to the bottom left
    pixel,
  • if (x - 2^N-1)^2 + (y - 2^N-1)^2 ≤ 2^2N-2 then the pixel is black,
  • otherwise the pixel is white.

What is the length of the minimal sequence describing D[24] ?
