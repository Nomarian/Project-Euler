Problem 86

07 January 2005


A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3, and a
fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the room
the shortest "straight line" distance from S to F is 10 and the path is shown
on the diagram.

[p_086]

However, there are up to three "shortest" path candidates for any given cuboid
and the shortest route doesn't always have integer length.

By considering all cuboid rooms with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size
of M by M by M, there are exactly 2060 cuboids for which the shortest route has
integer length when M=100, and this is the least value of M for which the
number of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions is 1975
when M=99.

Find the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds one
million.
