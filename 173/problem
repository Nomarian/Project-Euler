Problem 173

22 December 2007


We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so
that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example, using
exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square laminae:

[p_173_squa]

With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one time,
it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.

Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be formed?
