Problem 288

17 April 2010


For any prime p the number N(p,q) is defined by N(p,q) = âˆ‘[n=0 to q] T[n]*p^n
with T[n] generated by the following random number generator:

S[0] = 290797
S[n+1] = S[n]^2 mod 50515093
T[n] = S[n] mod p

Let Nfac(p,q) be the factorial of N(p,q).
Let NF(p,q) be the number of factors p in Nfac(p,q).

You are given that NF(3,10000) mod 3^20=624955285.

Find NF(61,10^7) mod 61^10
