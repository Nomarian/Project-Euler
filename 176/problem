04 January 2008


The four rectangular triangles with sides (9,12,15), (12,16,20), (5,12,13) and
(12,35,37) all have one of the shorter sides (catheti) equal to 12. It can be
shown that no other integer sided rectangular triangle exists with one of the
catheti equal to 12.

Find the smallest integer that can be the length of a cathetus of exactly 47547
different integer sided rectangular triangles.
