Problem 323

06 February 2011


Let y[0], y[1], y[2],... be a sequence of random unsigned 32 bit integers
(i.e. 0 ≤ y[i] < 2^32, every value equally likely).

For the sequence x[i] the following recursion is given:

  • x[0] = 0 and
  • x[i] = x[i-1] | y[i-1], for i > 0. ( | is the bitwise-OR operator)

It can be seen that eventually there will be an index N such that x[i] = 2^32
-1 (a bit-pattern of all ones) for all i ≥ N.

Find the expected value of N.
Give your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.
