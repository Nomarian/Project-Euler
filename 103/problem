Problem 103

26 August 2005


Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call it a
special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the
following properties are true:

 1. S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
 2. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).

If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special sum
set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.

n = 1: {1}
n = 2: {1, 2}
n = 3: {2, 3, 4}
n = 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
n = 5: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}

It seems that for a given optimum set, A = {a[1], a[2], ... , a[n]}, the next
optimum set is of the form B = {b, a[1]+b, a[2]+b, ... ,a[n]+b}, where b is the
"middle" element on the previous row.

By applying this "rule" we would expect the optimum set for n = 6 to be A =
{11, 17, 20, 22, 23, 24}, with S(A) = 117. However, this is not the optimum
set, as we have merely applied an algorithm to provide a near optimum set. The
optimum set for n = 6 is A = {11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25}, with S(A) = 115 and
corresponding set string: 111819202225.

Given that A is an optimum special sum set for n = 7, find its set string.

NOTE: This problem is related to problems 105 and 106.
