Problem 245

15 May 2009


We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.
Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the
ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = ^4⁄[11].

The resilience of a number d > 1 is  φ(d)   , where φ is Euler's totient
then                                 [blac] function.
                                     d - 1

                                                                n - φ(n)
We further define the coresilience of a number n > 1 as C(n) =  [blackdo] .
                                                                n - 1

                                         1
The coresilience of a prime p is C(p) =  [blac] .
                                         p - 1

Find the sum of all composite integers 1 < n ≤ 2x10^11, for which C(n) is a
unit fraction.

Note: the upper limit has been changed recently. Check out that you use the
right upper limit.
