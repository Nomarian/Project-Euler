Problem 123

16 June 2006


Let p[n] be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when
(p[n]−1)^n + (p[n]+1)^n is divided by p[n]^2.

For example, when n = 3, p[3] = 5, and 4^3 + 6^3 = 280 ≡ 5 mod 25.

The least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^9 is 7037.

Find the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 10^10.
