Problem 66

26 March 2004


Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

x^2 – Dy^2 = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 649^2 – 13x180^2 = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is
square.

By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the
following:

3^2 – 2x2^2 = 1
2^2 – 3x1^2 = 1
9^2 – 5x4^2 = 1
5^2 – 6x2^2 = 1
8^2 – 7x3^2 = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest x is
obtained when D=5.

Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest
value of x is obtained.
