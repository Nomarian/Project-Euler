Problem 119

07 April 2006


The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits
raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8^3 = 512. Another example of a number
with this property is 614656 = 28^4.

We shall define a[n] to be the nth term of this sequence and insist that a
number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that a[2] = 512 and a[10] = 614656.

Find a[30].
