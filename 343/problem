Problem 343

18 June 2011


For any positive integer k, a finite sequence a[i] of fractions x[i]/y[i] is
defined by:
a[1] = 1/k and
a[i] = (x[i-1]+1)/(y[i-1]-1) reduced to lowest terms for i>1.
When a[i] reaches some integer n, the sequence stops. (That is, when y[i]=1.)
Define f(k) = n.
For example, for k = 20:

1/20 → 2/19 → 3/18 = 1/6 → 2/5 → 3/4 → 4/3 → 5/2 → 6/1 = 6

So f(20) = 6.

Also f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1 and Σf(k^3) = 118937 for 1 ≤ k ≤ 100.

Find Σf(k^3) for 1 ≤ k ≤ 2x10^6.
