Problem 177

11 January 2008


Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals AC and BD. At each vertex
the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides, creating eight corner
angles.

[p_177_quad]

For example, at vertex A, the two angles are CAD, CAB.

We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have integer
values when measured in degrees an "integer angled quadrilateral". An example
of an integer angled quadrilateral is a square, where all eight corner angles
are 45DEG. Another example is given by DAC = 20DEG, BAC = 60DEG, ABD = 50DEG,
CBD = 30DEG, BCA = 40DEG, DCA = 30DEG, CDB = 80DEG, ADB = 50DEG.

What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals?

Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is integral
if it is within a tolerance of 10^-9 of an integer value.
