Problem 104

09 September 2005


The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

    F[n] = F[n−1] + F[n−2], where F[1] = 1 and F[2] = 1.

It turns out that F[541], which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci
number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the
digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F[2749], which contains 575
digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9
pandigital.

Given that F[k] is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits
AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
