Problem 215

31 October 2008


Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2x1 and 3x1 bricks (horizontalx
vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between
horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never
form a "running crack".

For example, the following 9x3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack
shown in red:

[p_215_crac]

There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9x3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.

Calculate W(32,10).
