Problem 331

03 April 2011


NxN disks are placed on a square game board. Each disk has a black side and
white side.

At each turn, you may choose a disk and flip all the disks in the same row and
the same column as this disk: thus 2xN-1 disks are flipped. The game ends when
all disks show their white side. The following example shows a game on a 5x5
board.

                                 [p_331_cros]

It can be proven that 3 is the minimal number of turns to finish this game.

The bottom left disk on the NxN board has coordinates (0,0);
the bottom right disk has coordinates (N-1,0) and the top left disk has
coordinates (0,N-1).

Let C[N] be the following configuration of a board with NxN disks:
A disk at (x,y) satisfying [p_331_cros], shows its black side; otherwise, it
shows its white side. C[5] is shown above.

Let T(N) be the minimal number of turns to finish a game starting from
configuration C[N] or 0 if configuration C[N] is unsolvable.
We have shown that T(5)=3. You are also given that T(10)=29 and T(1 000)=
395253.

Find [p_331_cros].
