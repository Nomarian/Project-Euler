Problem 187

22 March 2008


A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For example, 15
= 3 x 5; 9 = 3 x 3; 12 = 2 x 2 x 3.

There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not necessarily
distinct, prime factors: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.

How many composite integers, n < 10^8, have precisely two, not necessarily
distinct, prime factors?
