Problem 346

03 September 2011


The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2, and 11 written in
base 6
(i.e. 7[10] = 11[6] = 111[2]). In other words, 7 is a repunit in at least two
bases b > 1.

We shall call a positive integer with this property a strong repunit. It can be
verified that there are 8 strong repunits below 50: {1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43}.
Furthermore, the sum of all strong repunits below 1000 equals 15864.

Find the sum of all strong repunits below 10^12.
