Problem 308

30 October 2010


A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of
fractions.

The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which
is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program
multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave
it an integer.

For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote for
prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:

17 , 78 , 19 , 23 , 29 , 77 , 95 , 77 , 1  , 11 , 13 , 15 , 1 , 55 .
91   85   51   38   33   29   23   19   17   13   11   2    7   1

Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program produce
the sequence:
15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, 4, 30, ..., 136, 8, 60, ..., 544, 32,
240, ...

The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 2^2, 2^3, 2^5, ...
It can be shown that all the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime exponents
and that all the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2, in proper order!

If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem 7
(find the 10001^st prime), how many iterations would be needed until the
program produces 2^10001st prime ?
