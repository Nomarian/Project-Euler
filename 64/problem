Problem 64

27 February 2004


All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be
written in the form:

√N = a[0] + 1
            a[1] + 1
                   a[2] + 1
                          a[3] + ...

For example, let us consider √23:

√23 = 4 + √23 — 4 = 4 +  1      = 4 +  1
                         1             1 +  √23 – 3
                         √23—4              7

If we continue we would get the following expansion:

√23 = 4 +  1
           1 + 1
               3 + 1
                   1 + 1
                       8 + ...

The process can be summarised as follows:

a[0] = 4,   1      =  √23+4     = 1 +  √23—3
            √23—4     7                7
a[1] = 1,   7      =  7(√23+3)  = 3 +  √23—3
            √23—3     14               2
a[2] = 3,   2      =  2(√23+3)  = 1 +  √23—4
            √23—3     14               7
a[3] = 1,   7      =  7(√23+4)  = 8 +  √23—4
            √23—4     7
a[4] = 8,   1      =  √23+4     = 1 +  √23—3
            √23—4     7                7
a[5] = 1,   7      =  7(√23+3)  = 3 +  √23—3
            √23—3     14               2
a[6] = 3,   2      =  2(√23+3)  = 1 +  √23—4
            √23—3     14               7
a[7] = 1,   7      =  7(√23+4)  = 8 +  √23—4
            √23—4     7

It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the
notation √23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)], to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats
indefinitely.

The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square roots
are:

√2=[1;(2)], period=1
√3=[1;(1,2)], period=2
√5=[2;(4)], period=1
√6=[2;(2,4)], period=2
√7=[2;(1,1,1,4)], period=4
√8=[2;(1,4)], period=2
√10=[3;(6)], period=1
√11=[3;(3,6)], period=2
√12= [3;(2,6)], period=2
√13=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)], period=5

Exactly four continued fractions, for N ≤ 13, have an odd period.

How many continued fractions for N ≤ 10000 have an odd period?
