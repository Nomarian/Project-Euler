Suppliers 'A' and 'B' provided the following numbers of products for the luxury
hamper market:

                               Product       'A'  'B'
                         Beluga Caviar       5248 640
                         Christmas Cake      1312 1888
                         Gammon Joint        2624 3776
                         Vintage Port        5760 3776
                         Champagne Truffles  3936 5664

Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition,
there is inevitably some spoilage - i.e. products gone bad.

The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:

  • The five per-product spoilage rates for each supplier are equal to the
    number of products gone bad divided by the number of products supplied, for
    each of the five products in turn.
  • The overall spoilage rate for each supplier is equal to the total number of
    products gone bad divided by the total number of products provided by that
    supplier.

To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product
spoilage rates was worse (higher) for 'B' than for 'A' by the same factor
(ratio of spoilage rates), m>1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage
rate was worse for 'A' than for 'B', also by a factor of m.

There are thirty-five m>1 for which this surprising result could have occurred,
the smallest of which is 1476/1475.

What's the largest possible value of m?
Give your answer as a fraction reduced to its lowest terms, in the form u/v.
