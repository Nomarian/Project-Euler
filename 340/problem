Problem 340

29 May 2011


For fixed integers a, b, c, define the crazy function F(n) as follows:
F(n) = n - c for all n > b
F(n) = F(a + F(a + F(a + F(a + n)))) for all n â‰¤ b.

Also, define S(a, b, c) = [p_340_form].

For example, if a = 50, b = 2000 and c = 40, then F(0) = 3240 and F(2000) =
2040.
Also, S(50, 2000, 40) = 5204240.

Find the last 9 digits of S(21^7, 7^21, 12^7).
