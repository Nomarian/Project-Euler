Problem 217

14 November 2008


A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first ⌈^k/
[2]⌉ digits sum to the same value as its last ⌈^k/[2]⌉ digits, where ⌈x⌉,
pronounced ceiling of x, is the smallest integer ≥ x, thus ⌈π⌉ = 4 and ⌈5⌉ = 5.

So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.

Let T(n) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10^n.
Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) = 334795890.

Find T(47) mod 3^15
