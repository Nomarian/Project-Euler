Problem 277

06 February 2010


A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value a[1]
in the following way:

a[n+1] = a[n]/3 if a[n] is divisible by 3. We shall denote this as a large
downward step, "D".

a[n+1] = (4a[n] + 2)/3 if a[n] divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. We shall
denote this as an upward step, "U".

a[n+1] = (2a[n] - 1)/3 if a[n] divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. We shall
denote this as a small downward step, "d".

The sequence terminates when some a[n] = 1.

Given any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.
For instance if a[1]=231, then the sequence {a[n]}=
{231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1} corresponds to the steps "DdDddUUdDD".

Of course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence
"DdDddUUdDD....".
For instance, if a[1]=1004064, then the sequence is
DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.
In fact, 1004064 is the smallest possible a[1] > 10^6 that begins with the
sequence DdDddUUdDD.

What is the smallest a[1] > 10^15 that begins with the sequence
"UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd"?
