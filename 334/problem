Problem 334

23 April 2011


In Plato's heaven, there exist an infinite number of bowls in a straight line.
Each bowl either contains some or none of a finite number of beans.
A child plays a game, which allows only one kind of move: removing two beans
from any bowl, and putting one in each of the two adjacent bowls.
The game ends when each bowl contains either one or no beans.

For example, consider two adjacent bowls containing 2 and 3 beans respectively,
all other bowls being empty. The following eight moves will finish the game:

                                 [p_334_bean]

You are given the following sequences:

t[0] = 123456.

                                 t[i-1]
                                 2      ,                    if t[i-1] is even
t[i] = [p_334_case]
                    [p_334_lflo] t[i-1] [p_334_rflo] 926252, if t[i-1] is odd
                                 2

                    where ⌊x⌋ is the floor function
                    and [p_334_oplu] is the bitwise XOR operator.

b[i] = ( t[i] mod 2^11) + 1.

The first two terms of the last sequence are b[1] = 289 and b[2] = 145.
If we start with b[1] and b[2] beans in two adjacent bowls, 3419100 moves would
be required to finish the game.

Consider now 1500 adjacent bowls containing b[1], b[2],..., b[1500] beans
respectively, all other bowls being empty. Find how many moves it takes before
the game ends.
