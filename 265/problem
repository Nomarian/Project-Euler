Problem 265

21 November 2009


2^N binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the N-digit clockwise
subsequences are distinct.

For N=3, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:

                                 [p_265_Bina]

For the first arrangement, the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order, are:
000, 001, 010, 101, 011, 111, 110 and 100.

Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating the
binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most
significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for N=3 are
thus represented as 23 and 29:
                               00010111 [2] = 23
                               00011101 [2] = 29

Calling S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see that S
(3) = 23 + 29 = 52.

Find S(5).
