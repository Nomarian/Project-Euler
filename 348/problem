Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them
in more than one way.

Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square
and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways.
For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly
4 different ways:

2285^2 + 20^3
2223^2 + 66^3
1810^2 + 125^3
1197^2 + 156^3

Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
